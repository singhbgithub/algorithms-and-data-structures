# An Anthology of Algorithms and Data Structures

Hello all! This is my place to house all the programming problems that I have
solved that are have to do with algorithms and data structures. The main purpose
of this repo is to provide a place for me see my history, so that I can both
reflect and iterate on my past thoughts and ways of thinking.
